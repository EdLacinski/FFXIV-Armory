# FFXIV-Armory
This is a personal project to make a program acts like the WoW Armory

If you are reading this and interested in helping in this project please reach
out to me on Discord @ Eclipse#4998 this is the easiest way to get ahold of me.

I am doing this as a little passion project
think it would be a nice little exercise to learn some new things!
The goal is to make a working application that operates like the player search for
of the Lodestone but we only see what gear is equipped and its tool tips.
Much like how the World of Warcraft (WoW) Armory works and eventually strive for
Twitch Extension Integration.
